This folder is for storing local SDG icons.

If the external SDG icon URLs from the UN website stop working, you can:
1. Download the official SDG icons
2. Place them in this folder with names like "sdg-1.png", "sdg-2.png", etc.
3. Update the sdg-data.js file to use these local paths instead of the external URLs

Example path update in sdg-data.js:
icon: "icons/sdg-1.png"
